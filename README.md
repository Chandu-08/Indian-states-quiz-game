# Indian-states-quiz-game
India States  quiz Guessing Game is an educational and interactive project built with Python's turtle graphics and pandas. It displays a blank map of India and challenges the user to type the names of Indian states one by one. When a correct state is entered, its name appears on the map at the correct geographical location, highlighted in a randomly chosen color.
The game continues until the player either guesses all 29 states correctly or types "Exit". When exited early, the program generates a CSV file (states_to_learn.csv) listing all the states that were missed â€” making it a great learning tool for students and quiz lovers.
